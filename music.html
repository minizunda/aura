    <p>Anyway, I started listening to Vocaloid in October 2024. It was pretty w, and this is my playlist since then:</p>

      frameborder="0" 
      allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 
      loading="lazy">
    </iframe>
    
    <p>the embed only shows first 90 or so songs the heavy hitters are later in playlist</p>
    <p>i still do love vgms especially old ones like gimmick and kirby games</p>
